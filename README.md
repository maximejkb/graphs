# graphs
A NodeJS-powered network graph visualizer using D3. Allows visualization of various graph traversal algorithms.
The goal is to have the user upload data from a JSON file and have the D3 visualization automatically resize
appropriately. From there, users can perform and visualize graph traversals using DFS, BFS, Djikstra's, and A*.
Hope to implement shortest-path highlighting, as well as minimum-spanning-tree highlighting using Prim's algorithm
and Kruskal's. 

This uses NodeJS. Navigate to the directory and run "node app.js" from the command line. A local version of the 
program will run at 127.0.0.1 on port 3000 (http://127.0.0.1:3000/).
